# SaveTheEarth
The Prototype is essentially a superhero who can shapeshift. Now you may wonder, what's special about shapeshifting. That's where the catch is kiddo! This hero can shapeshift any part of his body to resemble a melee weapon. Not only that, he can shapeshift into any living being  and create an exact replica of that living being: from speech to mannerisms to food habits to memories... the list is endless. You won't be able to distinguish between the replica and the original person. All this can be done by just obtaining that person's DNA sample. The Prototype is extremely strong, agile, durable, dexterous and can lift most objects that we come across everyday. And by manipulating his body's strength he can even lift things as heavy as an army tank! His most powerful attacks are the devastators attacks which lay waste to anyone and anything caught in it. His most powerful devastator The Tendril Barrage makes tendrils erupt from his body which impale anything in it's path and these tendrils can stretch upto 10m. Such a strong hero has only one Achilles Heel: The Bloodtox Virus. The virus is a mutation of his own DNA which can render him powerless if he's exposed to it for long enough. Bloodtox Poisoning takes 2 weeks to heal completely, which can put him out of commission as a hero! Something he must avoid to help Save the Earth.
